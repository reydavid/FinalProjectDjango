    <p>Skillspire is a coding bootcamp on a mission to empower people to pursue the work they love. We serve adult age students (18+) who are looking for a faster and more affordable path to a new career or career advancement. Our goal is to level the playing field by providing training and mentorship to those from under-represented populations. We provide a welcoming environment for everyone, including low-income students, women, and minorities.</p> 
        
    <p>With ever tightening immigration rules, we see increased demand for local skilled talent. Many even come with prior tech backgrounds and degrees. Without pathways into our ecosystem, they end up in low-paying jobs: warehouses, airport, rideshares. By training students locally, we aim to source skilled talent locally so that tech companies don’t have to outsource or offshore, all while creating increased diversity in the tech companies.</p> 
        
    <p>The Founder and CEO, Yasmin Ali, being a minority woman from an under-represented community is able to connect and understand the background of the people that Skillspire targets. As a community activist for the past 10 years, she has been able to establish relationships with several CBOs, affinity and religious orgs.</p> 
        
    <p>In addition to empowering our students, we offer a solution for employers. Skillspire provides a pipeline to a diverse workforce filled with motivated, skilled, and adaptive talent. More and more companies are turning to a diverse population to stay competitive in today’s digital landscape. We train our graduates to be able to hit the ground running, so companies can feel confident that we will provide them with fresh, well trained talent. When you become our student, we champion for your success through one-on-one mentorship and job placement assistance. Skillspire is committed to the advancement and evolution of our students. We’re constantly adjusting our curriculum in order to give students the most up-to-date and relevant tech education of today.</p>
